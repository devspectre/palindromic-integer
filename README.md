# palindromic-integer

Finds palindromic integers among the list of integers
Do the job in a more optimized way, less code
Let's compare which one is faster, original numeric way or this string way

# Observation

The string way is definitely faster than the original approach.
Why don't we use more smarter and faster approach!
